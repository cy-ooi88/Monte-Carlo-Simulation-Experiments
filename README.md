# Monte Carlo Simulation is FUN!

## A friendly introduction without boring maths

The motivation behind this series of iPython notebooks is simple:

Statistics are generally taught (very) badly, especially the *really* important concepts.

I witnessed countless brilliant brains put to sleep in the typical Statistics training. (Mind you, these people are highly skilled engineers with brains that designed the most high end products in an insanely competitive market)

Words like 'Monte Carlo Simulations' became insanely sexy and hyped up. Actually they are real simple concepts.

My job here is to make Monte Carlo simulations unsexy and uncool. It should just become one of the tools in scientists and engineers arsenal.
